## If you own a reroll discord 
Setup your discord bot so it updates an online list with all the vip ids. 
Ex : The list from my discord : https://donphan.duckdns.org/vip_ids.txt. 

If you lack of a bot with this functionality, i recommand using my friend's bot, it already has this function included : https://github.com/TheThobi/PTCGPRerollManager

# Updates
## 09/03/2025
- Fixed macro not pausing Arturo's macro for some reason
- Fixed the 5 min update cooldown on gist list. Basically it creates a fresh raw link of the gist git to get the updated list.
 
## 06/03/2025
- 100% scaling  âœ… (now should correctly detect the ok button)
- running without arturo's macro âœ…  (now work without having arturo's macro oppened)
- corean language breaking detection âœ…  (verified and it works fine so idk)
- some id being added to the custom list âœ…  (they don't anymore)
- error with webhook and downloading the list with a bad internet âœ…  (now it will try to send the webhook message and download the list over and over again until it's done)
- restarting macro after clear once âœ… (you gotta unpause manually now if cleared once)
- macro not closing after clicking on the exit button âœ…

## 04/03/2025 
- Fixed some bugs that occured when you're running the macro on 100% scaling, should run smoothly now. 
- Optimized some detection functions that could fail and slow down the bot.

# Incoming Functionalities : 
- Fixed GUI for 100% scaling 
- Auto test GP 
- Auto pick GP with certain cards and free wonder pick
- Another theme for the GUI (some people told me my GUI was ugly ðŸ˜­)

# If you find any bugs, have feebacks, a functionality you want me to add or need some help
My dms are opened (i speak english and french)
My discord : sim_g 
Also don't hesitate to invite me to your reroll servers, i'd really like to see how things works in other groups.
