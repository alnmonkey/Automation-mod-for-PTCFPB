## If you own a reroll discord 
Setup your discord bot so it updates an online list with all the vip ids. 
Ex : The list from my discord : https://donphan.duckdns.org/vip_ids.txt. 

If you lack of a bot with this functionality, i recommand using my friend's bot, it already has this function included : https://github.com/TheThobi/PTCGPRerollManager
